My name is Jordan. I've been a builder since I was a kid, evolving from Legos and video games to machine learning models and AI systems. I work on developing ML pipelines and AI applications using Python, specializing in both traditional statistical approaches and modern deep learning frameworks. 

My experience spans from platform engineering to data science, where I focus on building scalable AI solutions. I'm passionate about working on several open-source ML projects that I'm building in public, contributing to the AI community while continuously learning and experimenting with emerging technologies.
