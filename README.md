Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience building scalable, resilient platforms and distributed systems. I specialize in backend and infrastructure engineering with deep expertise in CI/CD pipelines, cloud-native architectures, and software design using ASP.NET and Blazor.

I‚Äôve architected and deployed distributed applications that support real-time workloads, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability. My work includes modernizing legacy systems, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and optimizing performance in complex, cloud-based environments.

I‚Äôm passionate about building robust systems that scale with the business. I leverage automation and thoughtful software design to improve engineering velocity, developer experience, and operational reliability.
